# CS50-course-Harvard
This repository contains projects that I did during the Harvard course "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript". This course is about design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap.

Project 0 -> Design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.
Project 1 -> Design a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia.
